DEPRECATED (2026-11-12) - HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY. DO NOT REGENERATE THE DELIVERABLE.

The authoritative deck is the 21-slide English presentation at
`submission/CDS540_Final_Presentation_Deck.pptx` (merged via PR #5, commit 84ae5ee),
shipped with `submission/RoadInsight_Demo_EN.mp4`, `submission/RoadInsight_Demo_EN.srt`
and `submission/presentation_support/` (including a SHA256 checksum manifest).
This legacy script still builds the old 18-slide draft into `reports/`, and its
wording predates DECISIONS.md D08 (it still says "Unseen US Highway Evaluation").
Running it cannot reproduce the current deck; it would produce a stale,
non-compliant draft that could be mistaken for the submission. The current deck
is a separately delivered artifact: editing it requires the PR #5 toolchain so
the checksum manifest and the three PNG previews are regenerated together.
